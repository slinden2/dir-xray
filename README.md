# dir-xray
Dir XRAY utility is a small software that allows you to
make xray files of you file system. Two xray files may be compared
between each other in order to see what has changed between the creation
instants of the files.

HOW TO USE IT?
Create an xray of your the folder where all your programs
are installed. Then install/remove a program to/from the same destination.
After the (un)installation is complete, create another xray of the same
destination. Now you should have two separe xrays in your file system and
you can proceed with the comparison.

The program will print out new files, modified files and removed files.

WHERE THE XRAYS ARE SAVED?
The xray files are saved by default to the same directory from where you
run the .py file. If you want to change the location, you can set it by
selecting <4> from the main menu.

LIST XRAY FILES
You may wonder why doesn't <2> List xray files discover all of your xrays.
It always searches for the xrays files from the save directory, so if you
have changed the save directory between xrays, you will find the files only from the most recent location.
